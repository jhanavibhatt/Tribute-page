                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was a Hindu monk and spiritual leader who is best known for his role in
                    introducing Hindu philosophy and Vedanta to the Western world. He was a disciple of the Indian
                    mystic Ramakrishna and founded the Ramakrishna Math and Mission in 1897. Vivekananda was a prolific
                    writer and speaker and is considered one of the most influential figures of the Indian Renaissance.

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Vivekananda was born into an aristocratic family in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India, in 1863. His
                    given name was Narendranath Datta. He was educated at the Presidency College in Kolkata and later at
                    the Scottish Church College. As a young man, he was interested in the Western rationalist tradition
                    and was also drawn to the teachings of Ramakrishna, a mystic who lived in Kolkata.</p>

                <h2>Teachings</h2>
                <p>Vivekananda's teachings are based on the Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, which emphasizes the unity
                    of all beings and the ultimate reality of the universe. He believed that the highest goal of human
                    life is to realize one's true nature as a divine being and to attain liberation from the cycle of
                    birth and death. Vivekananda's message was one of self-empowerment and social reform, and he
                    emphasized the importance of education and spiritual practice in achieving these goals.</p>
